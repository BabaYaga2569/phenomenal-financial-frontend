# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Current Status
✅ GitHub Actions workflow is properly configured  
✅ React app builds successfully  
✅ Build outputs are correctly structured  
✅ App runs perfectly locally  

## Issue
GitHub Pages is showing a directory listing instead of the React app, despite successful workflow runs.

## Root Cause
The most likely cause is that GitHub Pages is not configured to use GitHub Actions as the deployment source.

## Solution: Configure GitHub Pages Source

To fix this issue, the repository owner needs to:

1. **Go to Repository Settings**
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/BabaYaga2569/phenomenal-financial-frontend/settings

2. **Configure Pages Settings**
   - Scroll down to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar
   - Click on "Pages"

3. **Set Source to GitHub Actions**
   - Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"** instead of "Deploy from a branch"
   - This tells GitHub Pages to use the workflow artifacts instead of serving files directly from a branch

4. **Verify Configuration**
   - The setting should show "GitHub Actions" as the source
   - GitHub will automatically detect the deployment workflow

## Alternative Verification Steps

If the above doesn't work, also check:

1. **Repository Visibility**: Ensure the repository is public (required for GitHub Pages on free accounts)
2. **Workflow Permissions**: Verify that Actions have permission to deploy to Pages
3. **Branch Protection**: Ensure main branch allows Actions to deploy

## Expected Result
After configuring GitHub Pages to use GitHub Actions as the source:
- The site at https://babayaga2569.github.io/phenomenal-financial-frontend/ should show the React app
- The dark theme financial dashboard should be visible
- Account cards for SoFi and Bank of America should display correctly

## Technical Details
- Build artifacts are correctly generated in `/build` directory
- React app is configured with proper homepage: `/phenomenal-financial-frontend/`
- Deployment workflow uses latest GitHub Actions for Pages deployment
- All assets include proper path prefixes for subdirectory hosting

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist after configuration:
1. Trigger a new deployment by pushing a commit to main branch
2. Check Actions tab for any deployment failures
3. Verify the Pages environment is properly configured in repository settings
